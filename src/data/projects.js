      "In collaboration with Nordic Light Hotel we organized a series of events during a couple of months in their hotel. To start off we organized a mural painted by graffiti artists Klive and Ligisd in the hotel bar Maskineriet. During christmas season a choir from a local school sang christmas songs dressed in dresses made with artwork from graffiti artist OKOK. Afterwards we organized a mingle and an auction of the artworks. As a grand finale we invited New York graffiti legend James Top, he held seminars and met with fans. We also produced the very first podcast about graffiti in Stockholm, it was recorded at Nordic Light Hotel and James Top was one of the guests on the show.",
