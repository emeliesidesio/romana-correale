      "To whom this may concern,\n\nWe had the pleasure to collaborate with Mme. Francesca Romana Correale for our annual fundraising charity gala held at the Cercle Interalliée, Paris in 2018 with our guest of honour, M. Carlos Ghosn. Mme. Correale represented the Italian Jewellery brand, Corsi Gioielli, that were sold at auction.\n\nSince the moment of contact, we had very effective communication with her. She delivered all the media without delay. She handled the biographies of herself and the jewellery maker. She took the initiative to spread the word our gala dinner on social media platforms and executed it brilliantly. She promoted and shared our message wholeheartedly. Francesca came very early to set up the jewellery exhibition table without needing our help, which we appreciated greatly. During the gala dinner, she interacted with our guests, regardless of the language barrier and was able to make connections with the Lebanese personalities.\n\nWe appreciate how experienced and professional Francesca was before, during and after the gala dinner. Well organised, respectful and always on time. She brought to the table new ideas and took the initiative whenever it was needed. She is very reliable and knows how to interact with all social categories.\n\nWe would without hesitation work with Francesca Romana Correale again and highly recommend her.\n\nWe remain at your disposal for any further questions.\n\nSincerely,\nNaoum Abi-Rached"

      "To Whom It May Concern:\n\nAt the beginning of August 2011 and well into the present day, I had the privilege to meet, once again, Francesca Romana Correale, whom I had known already since 1984 (until 1988), when we both attended high-school at Colegio Internacional de Caracas, in Venezuela.\n\nClearly, much had changed by our second encounter, as we were both grown-ups and professionals. Francesca had by now become a very successful entrepreneur in the world of fashion and luxury goods, with her line of exclusive handbags, “Le Forme.”\n\nWhen I first looked at one of her creations, what immediately came to mind was the two-dimensional (subsequently, three-dimensional) fantasy world of “Alice in Wonderland,” in particular its Queen of Hearts character and the Card Soldiers. In their two-dimensional aspect, the Card Soldiers’ white surface –like those of Francesca’s bags- reproduce various shapes (or “forms,” if you will), representing different meanings (hearts and spades, are not the same thing). By the same token, a white sheet of paper can collect our thoughts in writing and can be then “clipped” together to other sheets of paper that tell the same story. Moreover, in their three-dimensional aspect, like the Queen of Hearts herself, Francesca’s bags are playful and cartoonish on the one hand, while being sturdy and reliable “cult objects/containers” on the other.\n\nHence, keeping these analogies in mind, all while associating the many thoughts that cross a woman’s head (in this case, Francesca’s head) during the creative process to the many objects that this same woman needs to constantly carry in her bag as a life ritual, one cannot but laud Francesca’s originality and inventiveness.\n\nIn all her creations, Francesca demonstrates absolute proficiency in her knowledge of the fashion world(s), and the products she delivers are of the highest quality. Besides her linguistic confidence in various languages, Francesca continuously demonstrates a sophisticated grasp of the complex substance of the luxury world and its ever-changing trends, working with extraordinary and tireless passion.\n\nHer direct inputs are crucial to every project she undertakes. As a friend, but more importantly, as a client, I am always very impressed by her discipline, professional attitude and ability to lead a team. I am, therefore, certain that Francesca will be able to apply her many skills to a wide variety of fields.\n\nSincerely,\nAlexia Maria Di Fabio"

      "To whom this may concern,\n\nI had the pleasure to take after school classes with Ms Correale at Stockholm International School in Sweden, back in 2012. She was a dedicated teacher who showed me the reality of having a collection of bags. From the logo creation to the extensive mood boards, she highlighted the various layers in being creative on a budget. I had the opportunity to follow assist her during her bag campaigns and her exhibitions. I learned the power of social media and the importance of having a story that women relate to. Ms Correale was patient, dynamic and extremely supportive during the classes, she took the classes outside of the room and enabled us to see experience all the different aspects of being in the creative world.\n\nEach class was different, each class was unique and she truly created a safe space for her students to feel free to express themselves and create. Ms Correale was both caring and yet very demanding, not allowing for any slacking off. She taught us the importance of responsibility and being accountable for our actions which differentiated the students who took the classes as a hobby and those who were passionate.\n\nAs an old student of her, I strongly recommend Ms Correale because she was an excellent mentor, a tough tutor and a reliable mentor. She taught us the ropes to this demanding business and to life itself.\n\nI stay at your disposal if you have any further questions.\n\nBest Regards\nHeidi Abi-Rached"

      "To Whom it May Concern:\n\nIt is with great pleasure that I recommend Francesca Romana Correale for any position of interest to her.  Ms. Correale would be a great asset to any organization she joins for many reasons.  I have known Ms. Correale for more than twenty years, as she was an art student in my classes at Colegio Internacional de Caracas in Venezuela.  She proved to be super creative, innovative and responsible.  Ms. Correale created fascinating two-dimensional pieces that were outstanding to both her peers and myself as her teacher, which included meaningful interpretations and handling of art elements.\n\nSome years ago, Ms. Correale founded Romana Correale, creating her own luxury line of handbags made of exclusive leathers in Tuscany in support of local artisans.  This incredible line came to be known in fashion circles around the world.  This venture showcased her excellent taste in fine craftsmanship, talent, as well as leadership.  More recently she has supported graffiti artists and their work via social media and exhibits, often working with charities in support of causes of importance to her.\n\nBesides being tri-lingual – Ms. Correale speaks Italian, Spanish and English, I have known her to be a problem-solver with a keen sense of determination.  She faces challenges head on and thinks outside the box to resolve difficult situations.  I am in awe of her capacity and leadership, not only professionally, but in managing her own life as well.  She has also become a special friend, sharing family events, accomplishments and travels. Francesca has a wonderful sense of humor and has shown compassion through patience and kindness. She is a dedicated individual, especially to her daughter and her family, at times confronting personal challenges with grace and determination.  I admire her fortitude and cheerful smile.\n\nI recommend Francesca Romana Correale with enthusiasm for any position for which she feels qualified.  Her experience, passion, creative spirit and professionalism would certainly benefit any organization she joins.\n\nShould you require further information, please reach out.\n\nSincerely,\nVictoria Ballas Armas"
